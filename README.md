# FormulaOne-DataViz

Every since I was a young kid, I have been facinated wwith Formula One. Theres just something about it. From the pit stops, race strategy, intense driver battles, global venues, and of course the engine noise. Now I'm luklcy enought in my adult life, that technology has progressed to the popint where I can wake up at 4:00 am and watch practice, qualifying, and the race (Im on the west coast of the US which means race times are all over the place :smile:)

## Overview

While browsing Kaggle datasets, I saw that there was a Formula One driver dataset from a wikipedia of all [Formula 1 Drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_drivers) that Kaggle contributer [dubradave] has posted. This project is my exploration of the Formula One Drivers dataset.

## The Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle Here: [Formula-1-Drivers-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/formula-1-drivers-dataset). For this project I have the `.gitignore` configured to not track the csv or subsequent data files from my machine, but I have included code in my notebooks and scripts that uses the [Kaggle Python API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) to source this dataset direction from Kaggle (requires Kappgle API configuration. Instructions found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#:~:text=is%20%24PYTHON_HOME/Scripts.-,Authentication,-In%20order%20to)
